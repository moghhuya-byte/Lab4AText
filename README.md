- Before final decisions are made and/or sanctions are applied, the student’s record should be consulted to determine if there were aggravating and/or mitigating factors to the academic integrity violation.
- Should a suspected violation of this policy result from, or be combined with, a suspected violation of Seneca’s Student Code of Conduct and/or another non-academic-related Seneca policy, the matter will be investigated and adjudicated through the processes found in the Student Code of Conduct.

## **Academic integrity**
> Within an academic environment, “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to six fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage.” From these values flow principles of behaviour that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action to ensure the credentials granted to students accurately reflect their demonstrated knowledge and abilities.
